# Not Tac Toe

![License Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-ISC-blue)

## Description

The classic Tic Tac Toe game with a twist!

The game is played misere, the aim is to lose (i.e. not complete a row), and both players use the X.

This project was built using MongoDB, Express, React and NodeJS. I built this from scratch implementing algorithms to detect when a board had been completed (for variable board sizes) and I implemented online multiplayer!
